# faster-r-cnn-fruit-detection-coco-api
Fine-tuned a Faster R-CNN (ResNet-50 + FPN) to detect apples, bananas, and oranges using a small object detection dataset. Training and evaluation follow TorchVision’s reference pipeline with COCO metrics (AP/AR) to assess detection accuracy and generalization on an untouched test set.
